# Estimation of a Random Variable

In the project, $X$  is estimated from Y when $(X,Y)$  has bivariate Gaussian distribution. I examined different ways of estimating random variable $X$ . They are distinguished by the information available. I considered three types of information:

$1.$ The probability model of $X$  (blind estimation),

$2.$ The probability model of $X$ and information that the sample value $x$ $\in A$,

$3.$ The probability model of random variables $X$ and $Y$.

and I estimated $X$ from $Y$ by using: 

$1.$ Blind estimation,

$2.$ Assuming that $X$ $>$ $\frac{\mu_Y}{2}$,

$3.$ Optimal estimation given $Y$,

$4.$ Linear estimation given $Y$, 

$5.$ Maximum likelihood estimation given $Y$,

$6.$ Maximum a posteriori estimation given $Y$.
