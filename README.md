# Random Signals Term Project(EE372)
In this project, the estimate of X given Y is obtained via different methods such as blind estimation, optimal estimation, linear estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, MAP estimation. 
What novel in this project is Box-Muller Transform. It is an algorithm to generate Gaussian random variable by using values of a uniform random variable.
